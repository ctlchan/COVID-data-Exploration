# COVID-data-Exploration
First-year final project for my intro to data analytics class.

This project uses R to do a simple analysis of COVID-data. It involves the importing and tidying of 12 data sets for this purpose. It is written as an RMD file to produce the final report regarding the overarching question: How does a countries "degree of development" affect the impact of COVID-19? This question is introduced in more detail in the final report.
